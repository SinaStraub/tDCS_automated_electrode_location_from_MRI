The core algorithm is discribed in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.08.693046v1.full.pdf, please cite, if you use this algorithm.
This package provides a few additioanl functions which have not formally been evaluated. One estimates very roughly distances between head landmarks (inion, nasion, left and right tragus) as well as head circumference.Additionally, the assign_cathodes function automatically assigns standard electrode labels (such as F3, AF1, AF3) to electrode coordinates that were previously unlabeled, and it operates independently of the specific electrode montage.
